# Alternatives

### Alternatives to the components

Given the large environment of available tools to standardise and correlate logs, we can often create a setup using other components that talk to each other. 

- [fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org/) is an alternative for logstash
- [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) is an alternative for Kibana
- [Druid](http://druid.io/) is a high-performance, column-oriented, distributed data store as an alternative Elasticsearch

### Full stack alternatives
- [Riemann](http://riemann.io/) aggregates events from servers and applications with a powerful stream processing language.
- [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/)
